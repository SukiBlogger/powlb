Welcome to my little, hidden corner of the internet. 
I’m surprised you made it here, but glad to have you on board.
May I interest you in a hot drink? Coffee, tea? 
I’m a tea person myself (became one after I moved to the UK, more on that soon) and I'd be delighted to offer you a brew from my collection, but chances are you are somewhere far away from me at the moment, so you might need to grab that cuppa yourself. 

## Proof of Work-Life Balance
Surely if you have any knowledge of blockchain technology, you must find the name of my blog hilarious. I know I do!
I thought of it sometime in September 2023, made a note of it, and then completely forgot about it until I stumbled upon said note today. It's never too late to bring an idea to life though, is it?

If you fail to see why the name of my blog is brilliant, do some [reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) and come back. (Do come back though, don't get lost in some Wikipedia rabbit hole, hard as that may be!)



## What to expect from this blog

In a way, this is just an outlet for all the thoughts that don’t make it to my daily journal. Luckily for you, I already cover most of my wacky dreams and heartbreak stories there, so we can focus on more interesting parts of my life here, like the aforementioned tea collection or Wikipedia rabbit holes.  


I do mention "work" in the name, and there probably will be some stuff along the way related to my work, but if I’m being honest I expect the “life” part to take over most of this blog, as writing here is also a way for me to maintain this infamous “balance”. 
Though come to think of it, it's a bit weird to consider one's work as separate from one's life, isn't it?
Anyway, too early for this train of thought.


There will probably be more of the mundane than the profound, but who knows, we might get there eventually.

## Photo time

I'll try to include pictures in all posts, to make them more funky and colourful.

Here goes the first one, which is the original photo behind the (current) banner of the blog. I took it this morning, shortly after waking up and noticing how beautiful the clouds looked outside my bedroom window. 
I was captivated for a while by the head of a big dog up there, but by the time I took out my phone the big dog was no more. 
Makes you think how ephemeral everything is in this world of ours.

Gazing at clouds travelling through the sky from the comfort of my bed has always been one of my simple pleasures in life.  

Till next time!
